Project Overview
  Data Exploration: Visualized class imbalance and performed necessary preprocessing steps like scaling.
  
  Correlation Analysis: Investigated feature correlations to identify key relationships and guide feature selection.
  
  Imbalance Handling: Applied techniques like undersampling and oversampling to balance the dataset and improve model learning for the minority class.
  
  Model Training: Trained multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, RandomForest) and evaluated their performance using metrics like confusion matrices, classification reports, ROC-AUC scores, and ROC curves.
  
  Best Model: The RandomForest classifier performed the best, accurately detecting fraudulent transactions.

Key Findings
Feature Correlations: Correlation analysis revealed important relationships that improved feature selection.

RandomForest Performance: The RandomForestClassifier showed the highest accuracy and reliability in detecting fraud.

Imbalance Handling Impact: Addressing class imbalance through data balancing techniques significantly improved model performance.
